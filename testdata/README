These files are read by the test_stats_gatherer.
Each *TestData.py file should contain a list of "Queries"
that the gatherer iterates through and saves results to the fe database
in the test_stats table.
Use TemplateTestData.py as a guide

Each test has an "id" which is the id you will use to reference the test from concordion.
Each test then has a brief description, followed by the SQL to execute.

NOTE: You can actually reference other tests from within the SQL by using this type of variable notation ${id}.
	Example: randomStructure = select structure from GXD_Structure order by random() limit 1;
		randomStructureResultsCount = select count(*) from GXD_Expression where structure=${randomStructure}
